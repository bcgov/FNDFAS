## COMMENTS:

Foliar analytical results for some nutrients differ depending on the methodology used for extraction and determination. In some cases, differences may be large enough to affect diagnoses of nutrient sufficiency or deficiency based on available interpretative criteria. Using functions developed from inter-laboratory comparisons, the submitted foliar values for some nutrients have been adjusted to "normalized" values from which diagnoses and fertilizer prescriptions have been developed. Normalization is necessary for consistent application of diagnostic and prescriptive rules. *No inferences should be drawn from the normalization requirement regarding the quality or integrity of the submitted foliar data.* Submitted and "normalized" foliar nutrient values (and calculated nutrient ratios), are both shown in the above tabular output.

Because there may be considerable inter-tree variation in foliar nutrient levels, a composite sample consisting of foliage from less than 10 trees per stand (or stratum) may not provide reliable estimates of mean foliar concentrations for many nutrients.

The presence of needle casts (e.g., *Lophodermella concolor*) or blights may prevent reliable diagnosis of stand nutrient status. Dead and discoloured foliage may have lower nutrient levels than unaffected foliage. Nutrient levels in green, current-year's foliage may be affected by the infection and defoliation of older foliage.

The presence of feeding injuries (i.e., stem de-barking) by red squirrels or other animals may prevent reliable diagnosis of stand nutrient status if foliage was collected from damaged trees. Sharp increases in the abundance and severity of feeding injuries have been documented following fertilization of lodgepole pine in the interior of British Columbia. It is recommended that a forest health specialist be consulted if fertilization of this stand is contemplated.
