<h2>COMMENTS:</h2>
<li> Foliar analytical results for some nutrients differ depending on the methodology used for extraction and determination. In some cases, differences may be large enough to affect diagnoses of nutrient sufficiency or deficiency based on available interpretative criteria. Using functions developed from inter-laboratory comparisons, the submitted foliar values for some nutrients have been adjusted to 'normalized' values from which diagnoses and fertilizer prescriptions have been developed. Normalization is necessary for consistent application of diagnostic and prescriptive rules. <I><b>No inferences should be drawn from the normalization requirement regarding the quality or integrity of the submitted foliar data.</b></I> Submitted and 'normalized' foliar nutrient values (and calculated nutrient ratios), are both shown in the above tabular output.<br/><li> Foliar B concentration indicates a severe B deficiency. Deficiency symptoms are likely visible, or will become visible after N fertilization. In lodgepole pine, the most common and noticeable visual symptoms of B deficiency are shoot, shoot tip, or bud dieback of the leader and/or lateral bracnches resulting in multi-leadered, bush crowns. Needles near the affected tips are often short and deformed, either dark green, or discolored. Needle malformations often occur before other external symptoms. It is suggested that the stand be re-visited to confirm whether visual symptoms of B deficiency exist.<br/><li> Foliage was collected at a time of year not normally recommended for foliage sampling and, as such, may prevent reliable diagnosis of stand nutrient status. Foliar nutrient concentrations may be strongly affected by the time of year in which foliage is collected. Foliar interpretative criteria are based on analysis of foliage collected during the dormant season. Refer to <A HREF='http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/Docs/En/En52.pdf'>'Foliar sampling guidelines and nutrient interpretative criteria for lodgepole pine'</A> for further information. <br/><li> Because there may be considerable inter-tree variation in foliar nutrient levels, foliage from 15 to 20 trees per stand (or stratum) is needed to provide reliable estimates of mean foliar concentrations for most nutrients. For routine diagnostic use, a composite sample, prepared by combining foliage collected from 15 to 20 trees per stand (or stratum), is a cost-effective way of assessing stand foliar nutrient status. Refer to <A HREF='http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/Docs/En/En52.pdf'>'Foliar sampling guidelines and nutrient interpretative criteria for lodgepole pine'</A> for further information.

<h2>DIAGNOSIS:</h2>
<p><em>see “Comments” above for factors that may affect the foliar nutrient diagnosis</em></p>
<div id="nitrogen-n" class="section level3">
<h3>Nitrogen (N):</h3>
<p>Foliar N concentration indicates moderate to severe N deficiency that will likely negatively affect stand performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="phosphorus-p" class="section level3">
<h3>Phosphorus (P):</h3>
<p>Foliar P concentration indicates no P deficiency.</p>
<p>Foliar N:P ratio indicates no P deficiency. Results from research trials in the B.C. interior indicate there is low risk of inducing P deficiency following N fertilization.</p>
</div>
<div id="potassium-k" class="section level3">
<h3>Potassium (K):</h3>
<p>Foliar K concentration indicates slight to moderate K deficiency. However, results from research trials in the B.C. interior indicate that K status will likely not have a serious negative impact on stand performance and/or growth response following N fertilization.</p>
<p>However, foliar N:K of the sample and the results from research trials in the B.C. interior indicate that K status will likely not have a serious negative impact on stand performance and/or growth response following N fertilization.</p>
</div>
<div id="calcium-ca" class="section level3">
<h3>Calcium (Ca):</h3>
<p>Foliar Ca concentration indicates no Ca deficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="magnesium-mg" class="section level3">
<h3>Magnesium (Mg):</h3>
<p>Foliar Mg concentration indicates no Mg deficiency. Foliar N:Mg ratio indicates no Mg deficiency. Results from research trials in the B.C. interior indicate there is low risk of inducing Mg deficiency following N fertilization.</p>
</div>
<div id="sulphur-s" class="section level3">
<h3>Sulphur (S):</h3>
<p>Foliar S concentration indicates moderate to severe S deficiency. However, foliar SO4 and N/S ratio have greater diagnostic value than total S. Foliar N:S ratio indicates no S deficiency. However, research trials in the B.C. interior indicate S deficiency may be induced by N fertilization and that growth response may be enhanced with the addition of S to the fertilizer prescription. Foliar SO4 concentration indicates slight to moderate S deficiency. Results from research trials in the B.C. interior indicate that growth response following N fertilization may be improved if S is added to the fertilizer prescription. In the absence of ‘normalized’ foliar S and/or SO4 data, interpretative criteria used for S diagnosis may not apply to analytical methods used by the laboratory to which this foliage sample was submitted.</p>
</div>
<div id="copper-cu" class="section level3">
<h3>Copper (Cu):</h3>
<p>Foliar Cu concentration indicates no Cu deficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="zinc-zn" class="section level3">
<h3>Zinc (Zn):</h3>
<p>Foliar Zn concentration indicates no Zn deficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="iron-fe" class="section level3">
<h3>Iron (Fe):</h3>
<p>Foliar Fe concentration indicates no Fe deficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="manganese-mn" class="section level3">
<h3>Manganese (Mn):</h3>
<p>Foliar Mn concentration indicates probable Mn deficiency that may negatively affect stand performance and/or growth response following N fertilization. Probable Mn deficiencies are uncommon in the B.C. interior, and growth responses to fertilization are not well documented. Therefore, it is suggested that a tree nutrition specialist be consulted. Deficiency symptoms may, or may not, be visible. Refer to ‘Visual Deficiency Symptoms’ for common and noticeable symptoms of Mn deficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="boron-b" class="section level3">
<h3>Boron (B):</h3>
<p>Foliar B concentration indicates severe B deficiency, likely induced or exacerbated by N fertilization. Results from research trials in the B.C. interior indicate that risk of reduced height increment and/or top dieback is high. Deficiency symptoms are likely visible. Refer to ‘Visual Deficiency Symptoms’ for common and noticeable symptoms of B deficiency.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="fertilizer-prescription" class="section level2">
<h2>FERTILIZER PRESCRIPTION:</h2>
<li> Foliar diagnosis indicates N deficiency. Recommended fertilizer prescription to correct N deficiency is 175-225 kg N/ha, using urea (46-0-0) as the primary N source.<br/><li> Foliar diagnosis indicates S deficiency may potentially be induced by N fertilization. Results from research trials indicate that growth response may be improved if S is added in combination with N. The inclusion of 50-75 kg S/ha (as ammonium sulphate [21-0-0]) in the fertilizer prescription may be warranted.<br/><li> In the absence of foliar SO4 data, the need to include sulphur in the fertilizer prescription cannot be reliably determined. However, foliar N/S indicates that S deficiency may potentially be induced by N fertilization. Results from research trials indicate that growth response may be improved if S is added in combination with N. The inclusion of 50-75 kg S/ha (as ammonium sulphate [21-0-0]) in the fertilizer prescription may be warranted.<br/><li> Foliar diagnosis indicates Mn deficiency is probable. Growth response of lodgepole pine following Mn fertilization in the B.C. interior is not well documented. It is recommended that a tree nutrition specialist be consulted before including Mn in the fertilizer prescription.<br/><li> Available research information indicates that slight to moderate macronutrient (P, K, Ca, Mg) deficiencies do not prevent favourable responses to N fertilization. Therefore, the addition of these nutrients to the fertilizaer prescription is currently not recommended.<br/><li> Foliar diagnosis indicates B is severely deficient. It is strongly recommended that 2-3 kg B/ha (as granular borate [15% B]) be included in the fertilizer prescription.
